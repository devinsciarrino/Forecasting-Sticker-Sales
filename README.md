These two models where my submissions for the forecasting sticker sales in the Kaggle playground series. The data came from kaggles and was synthetically generated. The first was a random forest model with 500 trees and the second a rdige regression. In training the models some of the data needed imputation. I used a mean imputation technique, using the average of all the sticker sales figures per order to fill in the missing data. In the scoreboard ranking, neihter of the models did very well with the random forest doing better of the two. This came down to my imputation technique. instead of using the average of all the observation, I should have broken down the average of each country, sticker supply company, and time period in which they ordered. At the time of creating the models I had not thought of doing this. After reading the work of other competitors, I realized I should have put more weight into the seasonality of the time series data, and less on which country, or company the stickers came from.
